## Overall Enrollment

## Follow-up and Withdraw Status by Randomization Group

**Missed visits** are identified as those where a participant should have had a visit by the date the data was pulled, but no data is recorded. This calculation does not count participants as missing a visit after they have formally withdrawn.

For any row in the table, columns for Completed Visit, Cumulative Withdrew, and To Be Completed add to the total number enrolled. 

### Group 1

### Group 2

## Withdraw by Randomization Group
